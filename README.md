# ACCT653 Forecasting and Forensic Analytics

[Master of Science in Accounting (Data & Analytics) (MSA)](https://accountancy.smu.edu.sg/master-accounting)

[Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://www.smu.edu.sg/)

Jan to April, 2021

This course explores how financial statement data and non-financial metrics can be linked to business strategy and future enterprise performance. Students will use analytics techniques acquired from prior courses to explore how data is used to assess what drives financial performance and to forecast future financial scenarios. By the end of this course, students will understand how financial data and non-financial data interact to forecast events, detect financial discrepancies and frauds, predict corporate default, optimize operations, and determine business strategy. Some cognitive analytics methods such as text analytics, neural networks and deep learning will also be introduced. This course has been designed to equip students with analytics mind-set to create strategy and make better business decisions.

R programming skill is a must and Python is optional. The instructor will provide code in R only. Students are required to install R on their laptops. R is a free statistical language widely used by data science professionals. Students are recommended to install RStudio on their computers, a free R editor.

## Course Learning Outcomes

Students are expected to demonstrate the following technical competencies upon successful completion of this course:
1.	Understand the role of data and analytics in solving accounting and business problems, such as revenue prediction, bankruptcy prediction, and fraud detection.
1.	Demonstrate familiarity with statistical programming in the contexts of forecasting and forensics.
1.	Transform financial and nonfinancial data into useful insights for business.
1.	Communicate inferences from analysis through writing, speaking, and visuals.
1.	Develop an ability to independently learn and explore new methods in analytics in this ever-changing field.

Class activities are designed to further develop students’ analytical, communication, and active learning skills, as well as students’ professional ethics. Students must be prepared to go beyond seminar materials and prescribed reading.

## Course Assessment

The assessment components for this course are:

1. Class Participation	10%
1. Individual Assignments (including possible pop quizzes)	20%
1. Group Project	30%
1. Final Exam	40%
1. Total	100%

To pass this course, a student is required to attempt all the four components, obtain a minimum mark of 50% for the final exam component, and obtain a total mark of 50% or better.


## Detailed Lesson Plan

Class sessions are of three-hour duration per session and twelve sessions in total. The following is a tentative lesson plan. Note that this schedule is subject to change. Alternative times or activities will be arranged should they become necessary.

**Note**: Starting Aug 2021, most SMU post-graduate courses will be moved to 10-session format for 1 course unit (CU) with effective 30 contact hours. Hence this course will also be restructured to 10 sessions from Jan 2022.
